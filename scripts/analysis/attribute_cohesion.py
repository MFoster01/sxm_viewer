"""A5 - attribute cohesion: find the classes hiding inside the god object.

Builds the method <-> attribute access graph for a large class, then clusters
attributes that are consistently used by the same methods. Attributes that
always travel together are, by definition, one piece of state - i.e. a
candidate extracted class.

This is read-only evidence for the eventual decomposition: it replaces "I
think preview state belongs together" with a measured grouping, and it also
scores each candidate group by how *isolated* it is (how few methods touch
both it and anything else). Low-coupling groups are the safe ones to extract
first.
